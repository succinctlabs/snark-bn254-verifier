# Examples
This is a simple example of how to use the `snark-bn254-verifier` crate to verify a proof generated by the `SP1` library. The cycle count for running the programs varies depending on the proof system used:

| Program    | Plonk Proof | Groth16 Proof |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| Fibonacci  | 8,078,761   | 9,656,158     |
| Is-Prime   | 8,050,250   | 9,651,061     |
| Tendermint | 8,044,765   | 9,653,857     |
| SHA-2      | 8,078,621   | 9,637,958     |

To run the example, you can use the following ELF options:

| ELF Option | Description                   |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- |
| fibonacci  | Fibonacci sequence program    |
| is-prime   | Prime number checking program |
| sha2       | SHA-2 hashing program         |
| tendermint | Tendermint consensus program  |

To run the example, run the following command:
```bash
# Build the program
cd program
cargo prove build --bin plonk
cargo prove build --bin groth16

# Run the example
cd ../script
cargo build # Installs the circuit artifacts
RUST_LOG=info cargo run --release --  --elf fibonacci --mode plonk
```

### Wasm Example

To build the JSON proofs for the wasm example, run the following command:
```bash
cd script
cargo build
```

To run the wasm example, run the following command:
```bash
cd wasm_example
pnpm install
pnpm run test 
```
