# Fibonacci Example

This example demonstrates the use of the `snark-bn254-verifier` crate to verify a PLONK proof. The proof is generated by the `SP1` library for a Fibonacci calculation implemented as a RISC-V program. The "program" directory contains the verifier code that checks the validity of this PLONK proof, which is derived from the Fibonacci ELF file.

To run the example, run the following command:
```bash
cd program
cargo prove build

cd ../script
RUST_LOG=info cargo run --release -- --prove              
```
