# Fibonacci Example
This is a simple example of how to use the `snark-bn254-verifier` crate to verify a proof generated by the `SP1` library. This crate generates a proof of this [Fibonacci sequence program](https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1/tree/main/examples/fibonacci) from the `fibonacci-riscv32im-succinct-zkvm-elf` ELF file and then verifies the proof within `SP1`.

To run the example, run the following command:
```bash
cd program
cargo prove build

cd ../script
RUST_LOG=info cargo run --release -- --prove              
```
